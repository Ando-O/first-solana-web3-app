This project was part of _buildspace's **Build a Web3 app on Solana with React and Rust** EXPERIENCE.

A Solana *program* (similiar to contracts in Ethereum) was deployed that allows visitors to connect their Phantom wallets on Solana's Devnet.
The Solana program stores gif-link data that users submitted on the blockchain. 

Some design aspects were different for this project. 
The theme was MC Escher, and the background image was itself a gif.
Header text and buttons were all designed with a glitch effect.

WARNING: You might get a little dizzy going into this *Labyrinth*
